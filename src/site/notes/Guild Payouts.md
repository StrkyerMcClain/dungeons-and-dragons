### Magic Item Distribution
Guild payouts of Gold are used for general expenses and Guild Points are used to help ensure fair distribution of magic items across champions.

When a new item is found, it is brought back to the guild for detunement. Then it's put up for blind bids.

Bidders with equal balances can be given a short time to talk it out or roll off.

If the item is not bid on, it's put up for sale at twice the minimum bid price.

The items auctioned worth is split among party members who found it.
