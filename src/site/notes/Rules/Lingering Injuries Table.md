**Leg:** Your speed is halved and you need crutch/prosthetic to move, disadvantage on checks to balance, and fall prone after dashing.

**Arm:** You have auto fail on attack rolls that require two hands and strength checks/saves. You cannot hold something in an offhand you don't have.

**Eye:** You have disadvantage on Perception checks that rely on sight and ranged attacks. If you lose both eyes, you are considered permanently blinded.

**Hearing:** You have disadvantage on perception checks that use your hearing. A deafened creature canâ€™t hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.

**Internal Injury:** Make a DC 15 Con save or lose your action and reaction. (Coughing, overcome with pain, headache)
