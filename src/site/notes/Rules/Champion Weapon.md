When becoming a Champion, you have a custom weapon crafted for your character. Work with the DM to craft this customized, transforming, multi-use weapon. This allows champions flexibility in combat scenarios. This can include multiple damage types, multiple damage ranges, a spellcasting focus, or even a utility item.
