Most missions have the heroes returning to Champions Gate at the end of the session.

If characters have not returned home by the end of the session, they can use their champion weapon to teleport back to Champion's Gate.

If characters do not return to Champions Gate, then both the characters, and the area they are adventuring in, are put into [[Rules/Lockdown\|Lockdown]]
