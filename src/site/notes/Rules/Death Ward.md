When creating a character, a player may choose to give their character a Death Ward. With this feature, if a character would die for the first time, they instead roll on the [[Rules/Lingering Injuries Table\|Lingering Injuries Table]] and receive a lingering injury instead. 
#### *Characters without a Death Ward:*

Characters created without this protection are more connected to the world around them and receive **20% bonus experience points. and a [[Rules/Fate Point\|Fate Point]].**
