As an attack as part of your attack action, You can choose a direction and propel yourself 10ft in that direction with the force of a shot. (This can be a run, jumping, or even semi flight.) When landing, you take 1d6 damage for each 10ft of distance travelled and if you land on an enemy, they also take 1d6 damage for each 10ft of distance travelled. If there is an enemy within your range during your movement, you may attack them, if you don't attack an enemy during your movement, you can choose to make your attacks as part of your landing.
