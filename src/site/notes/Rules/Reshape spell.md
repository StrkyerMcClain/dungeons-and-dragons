#### Requires Spellcasting
As a champion, you have a natural affinity towards certain elements, which allows you to learn spells with alternate damage types. Champions can change damage spell, as well as make other customizations, upon learning a spell.

 Damage Type by Tier

| Damage Type                         | Tier |
| :---------------------------------- | :--: |
| Force, Psychic                      |  1   |
| Radiant, Necrotic, Thunder          |  2   |
| Acid, Lightning, Cold, Fire, Poison |  3   |
| Slashing, Piercing, Bludgeoning     |  4   |


 The change is permanent:
*For example, if you grab Acidbolt, you can't cast Firebolt unless you also choose to grab it with another cantrip slot.*

Changing Spell Damage Types:
**They can swap horizontally within a tier, or switch down in the tiers for free.**
**Switching up knocks down the damage die by 1 for every tier.**
**You can increase the spell level by 1 in exchange for +2 die size.**

 Changing save type:

| Save Type     | Tier |
| :------------ | :--: |
| Str, Int, Cha |  1   |
| Dex, Con, Wis |  2   |

The top 3 are *"Good saves"* for spells, and the bottom 3 are *"Bad saves"* for spells. 
- **Moving from Bad Save to Good Save costs you -1 die size.**
- **Removing Range or adding a negative effect can increase your die size**
- **Having no Rider Effect can increase your die size**
- **Granting limited AoE can reduce your die size**
- **No selective targeting can increase your die size**
