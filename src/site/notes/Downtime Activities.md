In between adventures, Champions can spend their time other ways.
### Crafting


### Levelling Up
In order to level up, champions must do research and consult with experts on their upcoming class features, and put in time training and practicing in a safe environment in order to level up. 
Levelling up requires **1 week of downtime** and **gold equal to 10 times your level times your proficiency bonus.** 

### Training a Skill or Proficiency
First, you need to find a mentor or instructor to teach you how to do the skill. They can range from a war general teaching you how to use a certain weapon, a professor teaching you a language, or a wood elf teaching you how to survive in the wilds.  The Champions Guild has many contacts across Champions Gate and can find trainers for Champions.
By the book, you can only learn a new language or tool proficiency, but if you want to learn something other than that, you'll have to run it by your DM first. 
After you find your teacher, you can spend a number of days and gold learning the skill, and at the end of the process, you'll be proficient in the tool or language. 

It takes **10 workweeks and 25 gp per workweek**, and the *number of workweeks is reduced* by a number of workweeks equal to the *character's Intelligence modifier.*

### Tactical Review
During downtime, champions can visit Selarra in the Champions Guild for tactical review of fights. Most encounters champions take part in while on Missions are recorded and Selarra is able to give tactical advice and critique your combat efficiency to help you improve as a champion.

### Carousing (XGtE)
You choose whether to spend time with the working class, or other champions, costing **10**, or **100 gp** per **week** respectively. 
During the week you mingle, party, and socialize with members of that social class. At the end of the **week**, you gain a number of contacts within that class. 
Some examples are criminals in the lower class, soldiers in the middle class, and nobles in the upper class. This option is great for collecting allies and intel, especially if you are new to the area. 
If your character is a charismatic one who needs information, like a Bard or an Inquisitive Rogue, then I would carouse with as much as you can.

### Relaxing (XGtE)
In order to relax, you must be able to maintain a modest lifestyle for a full week while you recuperate. 
You gain an **advantage against any diseases and poisons** affecting you, you **end any effect** that stops you from **regaining health**, and you can **restore one ability score** back to its original score if it had been decreased. All in all, if your character is injured or they just need to enjoy some R&R, recuperating is a good way of spending your downtime. If you complete a week of Relaxation without using any of the previous effects, you instead gain **Heroic Inspiration**.


### Researching (XGtE)
Resources
Typically, a character needs access to a library or a sage to conduct research. Assuming such access is available, conducting research requires one workweek of effort and at least 50 gp spent on materials, bribes, gifts, and other expenses.

Resolution
The character declares the focus of the research—a specific person, place, or thing. After one workweek, the character makes an Intelligence check with a +1 bonus per 50 gp spent beyond the initial 50 gp, to a maximum of +6. In addition, a character who has access to a particularly well-stocked library or knowledgeable sages gains advantage on this check.

**Research Outcomes:**

| Check Total | Outcome                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| 1–5         | No effect.                      |
| 6–14        | You learn one piece of lore.    |
| 15–20       | You learn two pieces of lore.   |
| 21+         | You learn three pieces of lore. |
